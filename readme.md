myConcertBase:
Concert Tracker allows users to post the concerts they attend either past or present. They can add the date, location and can rate and review the concert they attended. They can post media links, set lists and youtube footage of the show. As well as post venue information. They can also share memories from the show. This is the first version of this application. 

The reason I created this app was to log every concert and memories of those concerts in a database. For me the memories that go with the concerts are just as signifigant. The future version will allow a concert goer to instantly upload footage and photos to their myConcertBase mobile app. Another release will include the ability to search for past and current concert dates. As well as search for concert tickets for any event.
