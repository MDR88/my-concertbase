Initial Proposal
Name of Project: MyConcertbase
Brief Proposal:   Concert Tracker allows users to post the concerts they attend either past or present. They can add the date, location and can rate and review the concert they attended. They can post media links, set lists and youtube footage of the show. As well as post venue information. They can also share memories from the show. 


Overview of app: 
Concert Tracker allows you to add concert events that you have attended. The short term goal for myconcertBase is to track the concerts I have been to. This includes a journal to write about it, a rating system and media links. The long term goal is to be a social media concert experience app. Users will be able to post the shows they attended and post their memories and photos.  There will also be a way to search on past and current concert info on the band of choice. The application can expand to search for previous concert and information on bands. There will also be a message board to share comments and post photos or video links. 


MVP Definition: 
User will log-in to their home page or, register a new account.
The Home Page will display a list of added concerts and a Add New Concert Button.
The Add Concert Button will take you to the Concert Add Page form. 
The Concert Add Form fields will be; 
The Band Name, Date, venue, Rating and a text field to type in your memories of the show,
Place to add media links  to Youtube.footage or band page or link to a setlist.
The ability to edit text on each posting and delete. 
 





Dream Stretch Goals:
Add a 5 star rating system.
Add an external API of a site like BandsInTown showing past and future concerts, plus search for concerts. . 
Add a message board. 
More details about the venues. 
If the user selects a concert that they added the card will load. The user will have the ability to edit the fields of the concert form. 
 


Things you want your mentor to check in on:
 


User Stories (can be integrated into MVP definition):

A user can log in or register a new account.
Given a user wants to create a new account, they will perform a gesture on a “Register Now” affordance. Then a form will presented to the user in which the following information can be entered:
	1 UserName
	2. Email Address.
	3. Password
	4. Submit Button

Once the user performs a gesture on the “Submit Button” they will be taken to the users home page. 
	
Given a user wants to log a concert when a user performs a gesture on a “Log Concert” affordance.

Then a form should be presented to the user in which the following information can be entered:

Band
Venue “Location”
Date
Journal: “Text Box”
Photo or video URL Link “Text Box”
Text Box for the Set List “Text Box”


Once a user entered all of the values and performs a gesture on the “Submit Event Button” the form is stored to the concert database API. and they are taken to their home page. 

The home page will have a list of the concerts they have already added that is loaded from the database. The form will load with two additional fields, and “Edit Button” and a “Delete Button”. If the user selects the edit button, the fields are all editable. If they select Delete, the concert log will be deleted.
